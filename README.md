# order-desk-sync

In this testing tast I've realized a script which synchronize new orders from Order Desk application and show a line with id of order and an address line.

Unfortunatly, Order desk doesn't support a node sdk. It could be interesting for me to use new abilities and simplify my code more. But, I used axios for working with API and got acquainted with node-schedule.
